Dear TAs and Instructor,

Q2) There are two files for this question 
1)HW4_SVM - Has necessary functions. Doesn't need any input to run
2) HW4_SVM_banknote - Runs to solve bank-note problem. Needs .csv files for variable trainData = training data .csv path and 
variable testData = testing data .csv path. 
Output - Training and Testing errors for both the schedules in the questions, with learned weights and bias

Q3) There are two files for this question
1) HW4_Dual - Has necessary functions. Doesn't need any input to run
2) HW4_DUAL_banknote - Runs to solve bank-note problem. Needs .csv files for variable trainData = training data .csv path and 
variable testData = testing data .csv path
Output - Gives Training,Testing errors,number of support vectors for different values of gamma
