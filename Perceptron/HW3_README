Dear TAs,

There are two .py files in this folder

1. HW3_Perceptron.py - Contains Standard,Voted and Averaged variants of Perceptron. There is no input required for this file to run, neither does it have any outputs.
                       This file is only called by other files
                       
2. HW3_Banknote.py - Banknote dataset problem is solved by making use of functions defined in HW3_Perceptron.py.
                      There are two input .csv files that has to be given,
                      trainData = Training datasets .csv file path should be given
                      testData = Testing datasets .csv file path should be given
                      The variable 'output' will print Weight vectors and Error in prediction, for all 3 variants of Perceptron.
