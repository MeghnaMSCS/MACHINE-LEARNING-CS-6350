Dear instructors and TAs,

There are 3 files to consider in the Final submission.

1)ILP_Perceptron.py - This is a standalone .py file, which only needs .csv file path of training data and testing data to run. 
                      Predicted labels are written in .csv file
                      
2)ILP_HW1_ID3.py - This .py file uses functions and classes written in HW1_ID3Algorithm.py to work on the Kaggle dataset. Input .csv file paths for training data 
                   and testing data has to be provided.
                   
3)HW1_ID3Algorithm.py - This is same as HW1 submission for ID3 algorithm
